- +#21mar19-1319 U Reset Jekyll usage for GitHub pages
  - -#21mar19-1329 U Move "_*" directories from "05 ..." to repo root
  - -#21mar19-1331 U Move "image" directory from "05 ..." to new dir "Jekyll-assests" at repo root
    - -#21mar19-1332 i "Jekyll-assests" to inform directly about reason of its presence
  - -#21mar19-1320 i GitHub pages ignore "Source" setting / Source is always repo top level
    - -#21mar19-1320 i see https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages-and-jekyll#configuring-jekyll-in-your-github-pages-site
- +#21mar19-1318 U Four images for "multiple" test cases 
  - -#21mar19-1321 i I.e. not 3 & 5 but 4 each
  - -#21mar19-1322 i Firefox on Android tablet showed three images in "div" variant in one row
    - -#21mar19-1323 i While Chrome on same tablet showed only two images in one row
   - -#21mar19-1324 i More than four would result in three rows in line break variants
    - -#21mar19-1325 i Two rows are enough to show line breaks, more lines take up space
