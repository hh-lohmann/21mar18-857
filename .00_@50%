- @50% +#21mar19-1318 U Four images for "multiple" test cases 
  - -#21mar19-1321 i I.e. not 3 & 5 but 4 each
  - -#21mar19-1322 i Firefox on Android tablet showed three images in "div" variant in one row
    - -#21mar19-1323 i While Chrome on same tablet showed only two images in one row
   - -#21mar19-1324 i More than four would result in three rows in line break variants
    - -#21mar19-1325 i Two rows are enough to show line breaks, more lines take up space
