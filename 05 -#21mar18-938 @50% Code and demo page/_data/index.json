            "<samp>figure</samp> would be straighforward since it semantically clear encapsulates an image with a caption (<samp>figcaption</samp>). Unfortunatly it does not fit for <samp>overflow</samp> tweaking (see below)."

            "<samp>div</samp> is always suboptimal due to its lack of semantic and suits as a last resort only. With it there is also no semantically clear element for the image caption, the least complicated choice is <samp>p</samp> for containing a text block. Semantic roles should be expressed by classes (with class names that are not reflecting styling details)."
